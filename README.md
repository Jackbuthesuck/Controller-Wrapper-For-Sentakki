## üîß Building from Source

### **Requirements:**
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ Desktop Development
- Windows 10 SDK (includes C++/WinRT)

### **Build:**
```bash
build.bat
```

This compiles `ControllerInput.exe` from `ControllerInput.cpp`.

**Manual build:**
```bash
cl /EHsc /std:c++17 /await ControllerInput.cpp /link dinput8.lib dxguid.lib xinput.lib user32.lib gdi32.lib msimg32.lib windowsapp.lib /out:ControllerInput.exe
```

**All executables are fully portable** - copy to any Windows 10/11 PC and run!

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Antivirus

### **Why might this get flagged?**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses input injection APIs (SendInput, UWP InputInjector)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unsigned executable
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Simulates keyboard/mouse/touch (similar to legitimate automation tools)

### **Is it safe?**
‚úÖ **100% Open Source** - All code is visible and auditable  
‚úÖ **No network activity** - Doesn't send data anywhere  
‚úÖ **No persistence** - Doesn't install or modify system  
‚úÖ **Clean build** - Compiled with official Microsoft tools 
‚úÖ **Portable** - Single exe, no hidden files  

### **If flagged by antivirus:**
1. **Add to exclusions** - Safest for personal use
2. **Build from source** - Review code and compile yourself
3. **Virus scan the source** - Upload to VirusTotal if concerned
